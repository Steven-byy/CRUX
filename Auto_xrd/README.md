autoXRD
===========
## Description


autoXRD is a python package for automatic XRD pattern classification of thin-films, tweaked for small and class-imbalanced datasets. The main application of the package is high-throughput screening of novel materials.

autoXRD performs physics-informed data augmentation to solve the small data problem, implements a state-of-the-art a-CNN architecture and allows interpretation using Average Class Activation Maps (CAMs), according to the following publications:

## Installation

To install, just clone the following repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/PV-Lab/autoXRD.git`

## Usage

Just run `space_group_a_CNN.py` , with the given datasets. Note that this performs classification for patterns into 7 space-groups. Dimensionality data is not included in the code, please contact authors if interested.
The package contains the following module and scripts:

| Module | Description |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `space_group_a_CNN.py`      | Script for XRD space-group classification with a-CNN      |
| `autoXRD`      | Module dedicated to XRD pattern preprocessing and data augmentation       |
| `autoXRD_vis`   | Visualizer module for class activation maps (CAMs)     |
| `Demo / XRD_dimensionality_demo.ipynb` | Notebook containing a demo for physics-informed data augmentation. This is a version with a modified CNN and no CAM to speed up the computation
