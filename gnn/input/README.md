## Dataset

### node.txt

Node list: 

* The first column is the node's ID.
* The second column is the node's type: '0' for 'model' and '1' for 'data'.
* The third column of the 'model' node is the vector generated by [ast2vec](https://gitlab.com/bpaassen/ast2vec). 
  The third column of the 'data' node is the vector generated by Word2Vec, aggregated by the average vector for each node.

### edge.txt

Edge list:

* The first column is (model.id,data.id).
* The second column is the performance list: [runningTime(s), f1_score, precision, recall, Cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity].
* Only show the edge whose F1 score and runningTime(s) are not null.
 (Including 23/25 models and 2020/2021 datasets.)

### top5.txt

Edge list for top5 edges for each dataset:

* Performance = f1_score + cosine similarity - 0.1 * runningTime(s).
* Show the edges that get the top 5 performance for each dataset.

## Generate Steps

1. Import JSON files into Neo4j and extract relations by [kg_gnn.cypher](https://github.com/crux-project/CRUX/blob/main/neo4j/cyphers/kg_gnn.cypher).
2. Export test cards into CSV file and put under "/gnn/import/csv/".
3. Execute [csv2txt.py](https://github.com/crux-project/CRUX/blob/main/gnn/input/csv2txt.py) to generate the input dataset for the learning to rank model.
